### Hack-A-Weekend Women's Health Project

This repository contains the incomplete code I wrote during the Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science Scholarship (BUDS) hack-a-thon challenge. My team's plan to was to analyze global depression rates for women by country, by health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. I used Python with Plotly to create interactive maps of the depression and expenditure trends. Unfortunately, we were unable to proceed further, but I was pleased to have learned Plotly in the process!
